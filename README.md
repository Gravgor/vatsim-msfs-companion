# Real-Time Flight Tracker with Weather Overlay

![Project Banner/Screenshot](image.png)

A sophisticated real-time flight tracking application that combines VATSIM flight data with weather information, providing a comprehensive aviation monitoring experience.

## üåü Features

### Flight Tracking
- Real-time aircraft position tracking using VATSIM data
- Flight path visualization with curved great circle routes
- Aircraft information display (callsign, altitude, speed, heading)
- Ground traffic visualization
- Flight plan routes with departure/arrival information
- Aircraft following mode

### Weather System
- METAR data display for airports
  - Temperature, wind, visibility, and pressure information
  - Flight category indicators (VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR)
  - Raw METAR text and decoded information
- Weather visualization layers:
  - METAR stations with conditions
  - Weather radar overlay
  - Wind barbs showing direction and speed
  - Weather fronts visualization

### Map Features
- Multiple map styles (Dark, Light, Satellite, Terrain)
- 3D building visualization
- Terrain elevation data
- Customizable map labels
- Day/Night mode
- Airport information overlay

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Next.js 15** for server-side rendering and API routes
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Mapbox GL JS** for map rendering
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Map GL** for map components
- **Lucide Icons** for UI icons
- **ShadcnUI** for UI components

### Backend & Data
- **Next.js API Routes** for backend functionality
- **Redis** for caching weather and flight data
- **VATSIM API** for real-time flight data
- **CheckWX/VATSIM Weather API** for METAR information

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for git hooks
- Jest for testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Real-time flight data fetched from VATSIM
2. Weather data cached in Redis
3. Client-side state managed with Zustand
4. Server-side caching for API responses
5. WebSocket updates for real-time position changes

### Key Components
- `MapView`: Main map component with layers
- `WeatherOverlay`: Weather visualization system
- `PlaneMarker`: Aircraft visualization
- `FlightInfo`: Flight information panel
- `WeatherControls`: Weather layer controls

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- Redis caching for weather data
- Memoized React components
- Efficient map layer rendering
- Debounced API calls
- Lazy loading of weather overlays


## üîß Configuration

The application can be configured through various environment variables and settings:
- Map styles and default view
- Update intervals for data fetching
- Cache durations
- Weather overlay options
